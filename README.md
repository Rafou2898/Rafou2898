# Hi, I'm Rafael

I'm currently studying embedded systems at HEIG-VD. I enjoy working on both low-level and high-level technologies, from microcontrollers and FPGAs to IoT networks and automation servers.

## About me

- üìç Based in Switzerland
- Student in embedded systems engineering
- Interested in: IoT, automation, Linux, networking, wireless protocols (LoRa, BLE 6.0, Wi-Fi 7), and robotics
- Comfortable working in C, Python, Bash
- 
## Projects and labs

Most of my university labs are hosted on the following GitHub organization:  
[github.com/HEIG-VD-RD](https://github.com/HEIG-VD-RD)

These labs cover topics such as:

- Bare-metal development (FPGA + HPS on the DE1-SoC)
- OS porting and device drivers (Linux kernel)
- IoT with Arduino, MKR boards, LoRa
- Computer security and reverse engineering (GDB, Ghidra)
- Autonomous systems (Duckietown, Jetson Nano)
